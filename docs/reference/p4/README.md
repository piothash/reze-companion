# Polymarket 5-Minute BTC Maker-Snipe Engine

A dual-pipeline (V1 Paper / V2 Live) high-frequency **maker** engine for Polymarket's 5-minute Bitcoin Up/Down contracts, built on the CLOB V2 architecture (pUSD collateral, EIP-712 + HMAC L2 auth). Includes a cyberpunk web dashboard, an integrated Telegram control bot, and a local SQLite ledger.

> **Disclaimer:** Trading involves substantial risk. LIVE_V2 mode places real on-chain orders with real capital. Always validate configuration in PAPER_V1 mode first. Nothing here is financial advice.

## System Overview

The engine ships as **two fully isolated pipelines** that run in the same process under separate global singletons: `lib/v1/engine/` (PAPER_V1, simulated) and `lib/v2/engine/` (LIVE_V2, real orders). The trading core is kept byte-for-byte identical between them; only the executor, config, and a handful of live-only feeds differ. The tree below shows `lib/v2/engine/` (V1 mirrors it, minus the live executor and account sync):

```

> **One execution model.** The **Standing Limit Order** manager is the only engine: a CLOB-driven, majority-at-trigger limit order with fixed-share / dollar / percent sizing, restart recovery, and settlement-verified accounting.

### Core Safeguards (`lib/v2/engine/handlers/`)

Each safeguard is an isolated, pure, independently testable module the engine imports as the single source of truth.

- **Oracle Sync Drift Guard** (`oracle-sync-guard.ts`) — cross-checks spot against the Chainlink BTC reference with a padding margin (default `$12`, `driftPaddingUsd`). Note: the Standing Limit Order path is CLOB-driven and does not consume this guard.
- **Sub-100ms Cancel/Replace** (`cancel-replace-pipeline.ts`) — spot reversals against a resting order trigger an immediate cancel-and-replace cycle; latency is classified against the budget.
- **Orphan Asset Cleaner** (`orphan-cleaner.ts`) — if a hedge leg fails, the lone position is flattened with an immediate market-priced FOK counter, resetting exposure to zero.
- **5-Share Protocol Guard** (`protocol-validator.ts`) — allocations auto-scale up to clear Polymarket's 5-share order floor.
- **Compounding + Dust Sweep** (`dust-compounding.ts`) — `shares = floor(pool / price)`; fractional remainder is banked as dust and rolled into the next candle's capital pool.

## Requirements

- Linux VPS (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended), 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM minimum
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`)
- PM2 (`npm i -g pm2`)
- Low-latency region recommended (US-East) for Polymarket CLOB + Polygon RPC round-trips

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> polybot && cd polybot
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in your values
pnpm build
```

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

Variable names below are the **canonical** ones read by `lib/*/engine/config.ts`. Legacy `POLY_*` aliases (shown in parentheses) still work as fallbacks. See `.env.example` for the complete, authoritative list.

| Variable | Pipeline | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | both | `PAPER_V1` (default, safe) or `LIVE_V2` |
| `PAPER_STARTING_BALANCE` | V1 | Simulated starting bankroll in USD (default `100`) |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (`POLY_PRIVATE_KEY`) | V2 | Level-1 signing wallet private key. **Never commit.** |
| `FUNDER_ADDRESS` (`POLY_PROXY_ADDRESS`) | V2 | Proxy/funder address that holds USDC |
| `CLOB_API_KEY` (`POLY_API_KEY`) | V2 | CLOB L2 API key |
| `CLOB_SECRET` (`POLY_API_SECRET`) | V2 | CLOB L2 HMAC secret |
| `CLOB_PASS_PHRASE` (`POLY_API_PASSPHRASE`) | V2 | CLOB L2 passphrase |
| `SIGNATURE_TYPE` | V2 | `0`=EOA, `1`=proxy (default), `2`=Gnosis Safe |
| `POLYMARKET_CLOB_URL` | V2 | CLOB REST endpoint (default `https://clob.polymarket.com`) |
| `CLOB_WS_HOST` | V2 | CLOB WebSocket endpoint |
| `DATA_API_HOST` | V2 | Public Data API for account positions/value (default `https://data-api.polymarket.com`) |
| `BTC_REFERENCE_SOURCE` | both | `chainlink-onchain` (default) or `chainlink-datastreams` |
| `CHAINLINK_RPC_URL` | both | Comma-separated Polygon RPC(s) for the on-chain BTC/USD aggregator |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | V2 | From `@BotFather` — leave blank to disable Telegram |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | V2 | Your chat/channel ID for control + PnL cards |
| `DB_PATH` | both | SQLite ledger path (default `data/edge5.db`) |

To obtain L2 credentials, derive them once with your wallet key via the official SDK's `createOrDeriveApiKey()` — the `@polymarket/clob-client-v2` client performs the EIP-712 L1 signature and thereafter authenticates with HMAC L2 headers. The engine does not hand-roll any signing.

## Telegram Setup

> The Telegram control bot is owned exclusively by the **LIVE_V2** engine. Because Telegram permits only one long-poll consumer per bot token and both pipelines can run at once, the V1 paper engine does not attach to Telegram.

1. Message `@BotFather`, create a bot, copy the token into `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Message your bot once, then get your chat ID (e.g. via `@userinfobot`) into `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
3. Commands: `/start_bot`, `/stop_bot`, `/set_balance <amount>`, `/status`.
4. After every settled trade the bot pushes a PnL card: market, side, fill price, result, net PnL, compounded bankroll, dust reserve.

## Running with PM2 (production daemon)

```bash
pnpm build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save                 # persist across reboots
pm2 startup              # generate boot script (follow printed command)
```

Useful commands:

```bash
pm2 status               # process health
pm2 logs polybot         # tail engine + dashboard logs
pm2 restart polybot      # zero-hassle restart
pm2 stop polybot         # halt everything
```

The dashboard is then available at `http://<vps-ip>:3000`. Front it with nginx + TLS and restrict access (basic auth or firewall) — the control API starts/stops the engine.

## Dashboard (Cyberpunk HUD)

All tabs stay mounted — switching never interrupts the countdown, WebSocket tickers, or SWR polling.

- **Ops Deck** — V1/V2 pipeline hot-swap, ignition start / emergency-stop, paper funding box, the Standing Limit Order panel, live account, and saved operator profiles. Applied live, no restart.
- **Signal Tank** — millisecond drift-corrected candle countdown, UP/DOWN token boxes with electric-border flashes on target-zone entry, and the intelligence feed.
- **Ledger** — Market ID → Side → Shares → Compounded Capital → Dust Saved → Net PnL, with a running dust-reserve counter.
- **Analytics / System** — performance summaries plus runtime, database, and diagnostics tooling.

## Going Live Checklist

1. Run PAPER_V1 for a meaningful sample of candles; review the ledger win rate and drawdown.
2. Fund the Polymarket proxy wallet with pUSD.
3. Set `ENVIRONMENT=LIVE_V2` and all V2 credentials in `.env`.
4. `pm2 restart polybot` and start with a small bankroll.

## Troubleshooting: Engine Goes "Cold" (LIVE_V2 Market Discovery)

In **LIVE_V2 mode**, the engine displays `marketDiscovery: "waiting"` when:

1. **Market not yet published**: Polymarket (via Gamma API) only lists markets once they're active or have closed. Future-slot markets won't exist in the API until close-of-slot.
   - **Expected behavior**: The status shows `marketDiscovery: "waiting"` with a `liveMarket: null`. This is normal during the inter-candle gap.
   - **Fix**: Wait for the next slot to open, or check that your current slot exists: `curl https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug=btc-updown-5m-<slot-end-epoch>`.

2. **Gamma API unreachable**: The HTTP fetch times out after 5s.
   - **Fix**: Check your VPS network (firewall rules, geolocation). Gamma is hosted in the US; if you're blocked by ISP, use a proxy or switch regions.

3. **Live credentials incomplete**: LIVE_V2 start will refuse and log an error if any of `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FUNDER_ADDRESS`, `CLOB_API_KEY`, `CLOB_SECRET`, `CLOB_PASS_PHRASE` are missing (legacy `POLY_*` aliases also accepted).
   - **Check**: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v2/bot/status | jq '.liveKeysLoaded'` (should be `true`).

**Dashboard Health Signal**: Check the status endpoint's `marketDiscovery` field:
- `null` → PAPER_V1 mode (no market discovery needed)
- `"waiting"` → Actively polling Gamma for the current slot's market
- `"ready"` → Market resolved and loaded into the engine; ready to fire

## Safety Notes

- `.env` is fully git-ignored; only `.env.example` is committed.
- The engine never fires payloads inside the final 2 seconds of a candle (Priority 3 hold state).
- All live orders are strictly limit **maker** orders — 0% taker fees, rebate-eligible.
- SQLite state lives in `data/` (also git-ignored); back it up if you care about the ledger history.
