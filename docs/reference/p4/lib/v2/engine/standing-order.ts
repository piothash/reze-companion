// ------------------------------------------------------------
// StandingOrderManager — independent trigger-gated, majority-at-trigger,
// one-shot-per-window engine.
//
// Execution model:
//   • The user sets a Target Limit Price and a Trigger Price (≤ target).
//   • TRIGGER GATES TIMING ONLY: on each NEW 5-minute market the engine
//     continuously monitors BOTH the UP and DOWN contracts. The trigger is
//     considered reached the instant EITHER side's live best-ask is at/above
//     the configured trigger price. The trigger NEVER determines direction.
//   • MAJORITY-AT-TRIGGER DIRECTION: the instant the trigger is reached the
//     engine reads the same atomic snapshot for BOTH sides and buys the
//     current MAJORITY side (the higher-priced contract). No cached, prior,
//     or "first-to-trigger" side is ever used. If a fresh validated snapshot
//     is not available at that instant the order is withheld and the engine
//     retries on the next tick while still inside the entry window.
//   • ONE ORDER PER WINDOW: the engine submits a single LIMIT BUY at the
//     target on the majority side. After that order fills, the engine is
//     done for the window — it places no further orders and simply holds
//     the position (marks + PnL kept live) until the slot rolls over.
//   • Trigger fires immediately when the live price is at/above the trigger
//     (AT_OR_ABOVE, the default), including firing right away at arm/boot if
//     already there. UPWARD_CROSSING (fresh-crossing) is still available.
//   • Min/Max guardrails suppress operation outside the band.
//   • One resting order at a time. All open lots are settled together at
//     market resolution (early via Gamma `closed` detection, or at the
//     5-minute clock boundary).
//
// Runs on its OWN 1-second loop, sharing NO state with the strategy
// engine's tick loop, Time Window / phase machine, or open order.
